# Privileged* is a list of the given type allowed to bypass restrictions.
# Wildcards are supported (e.g. "system:serviceaccount:default:*" or "cluster-*-operator").
# ClusterRoles are only ever matched if they are bound through a ClusterRoleBinding,
# this is different from the behavior of Kyverno.
# This is done to prevent a user from wrongly configuring a low-privileged ClusterRole which users
# can then bind to themselves to bypass the restrictions.
